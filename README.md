# Generative character-level and multi-pitch-level rnn models in Pytorch


Implementation of generative character-level and multi-pitch-level rnn models described in "Learning to generate lyrics and music with Recurrent Neural Networks" blog post.

The original jupyter notebook source of the blog can be found [here](blog_post.ipynb).

Models can be downloaded via the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/23d9n091jje8sct/music_lyrics_blogpost_models.zip?dl=0).
